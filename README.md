# QuantumHackathon-RubiksCube
A Quantum Solver for a 2x2x2 Rubiks Cube

Author's: Quentin Bragard, James Conway, Steve Flinter, Nicola Mariella, Conor McQuillan
Problem Statement: As part of the UCD Qiskit Community Summer Jam, we were challenged to solve a unique combinatorial problem using Quantum Computing Techniques
We propose a quantum algorithm for solving a 2x2x2 rubiks cube.
